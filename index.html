                Hi, I'm Matt. <br>
                I am a fullstack developer & digital mapping enthusiast.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                At the very core of my being, I have a passion for building, problem-solving, and automating. I have
                been fortunate enough in my life to be able to create a career out of my passions and that culminates
                through web development, GIS, and digital mapping. I try to learn something from every experience I have
                and that has made me a lifelong learner.
                When I'm not geeking out on maps and new JavaScript libraries, I'm raising my beautiful children and
                spending time with my wife. I am also an old-time banjo player/enthusiast.
            </p>

                <!-- <span style="font-size:30px; position: relative; padding-left:70px; padding-top: 70px; background:darkgray; overflow: hidden;"></span> -->
                <p>This simple quiz application iterates through a series of ten questions, giving you feedback based on
                    your selection. When you're through, you can start over from scratch to try and improve your score.
                    This project showcases my ability to utilize JavaScript and jQuery to create simple, event-driven
                    application.</p>

                <p>This is a simple chloropleth map where I utilized some pre-processing with the Pandas, GeoPandas,
                    Shapely, and MatPlotLib Python libraries. Then used Leaflet.js to display the result of that
                    analysis.</p>
